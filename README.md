# Boiler Telemetry API

This API facilitates access to much of the telemetry data produced by my [US Boiler/Burnham Alpine boiler](http://www.usboiler.net/product/alpine-high-efficiency-condensing-gas-boiler.html) via the 
 "Boiler to Boiler" RJ45 port. The built-in "Sage2" controller exposes nearly all the data available on the boiler's
LCD display over this interface.

This has only been tested with my ALP105BW-4T02, but will probably work for other Sage2-era boilers. A 
register-scanning routine is included to discover additional registers on other Sage2 versions and models.

This code works well via a cron script (log_thingspeak.py) to log readings from my boiler to [thingspeak.com](http://thingspeak.com).

## Use Cases
* Debug installation issues, e.g. short cycling
* Track operation and usage

## Reference and Prior Work
* [Mini-Monitor](https://github.com/alanmitchell/mini-monitor/blob/master/readers/sage_boiler.py) contains a simpler [minimalmodbus](http://minimalmodbus.readthedocs.io/)-based API (minimalmodbus supports only Modbus/RTU)
* [Sage2 Controller Modbus Interface Documentation](https://www.ccontrols.com/support/dp/Sage2.doc) (circa 2012)
* [Honeywell SOLA Modbus Inferface Specification](https://customer.honeywell.com/resources/Techlit/TechLitDocuments/65-0000s/65-0310.pdf)
    * Found in excellent Mini-Monitor docs linked above!
* [modbus-tk](https://github.com/ljean/modbus-tk) is a uniform Modbus RTU and TCP implementation in python

## Physical Interface

### Boiler
The boiler has two RJ45 ports

| Port  | Protocol | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| White | [EnviraCom](http://www.google.com/patents/US20080112492) | Suitable for connection to [Sage Zone Control](http://www.usboiler.net/product/sage-zone-control-circulator-panel) panels and a specfic model of Honeywell thermostat ([TH9421C1004](https://customer.honeywell.com/en-US/Pages/Product.aspx?cat=HonECC+Catalog&pid=th9421c1004/U), now obsolete and not available for sale). Be careful connecting to this port as EnviraCom uses 24VAC signalling |
| Black |  RS485 | API access, Boiler to Boiler communication over Modbus/RTU at 38.4kbps |

Both ports are intended to daisy chain multiple controls/boilers together using a bus topology using splitters, e.g. http://www.l-com.com/ethernet-modular-tee-adapter-8x8m-8x8kf-8x8kf

### RS485 Interface
Any RS485 interface should work. Mine is a bare-wire [USB-RS485 FTDI Adapter](http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/Cables/USBRS485.htm) with a suitably crimped RJ45 jack.

### Modbus
The API works with either a directly connected serial interface (via [PySerial](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial)), or a Modbus/TCP bridge (bridging Modbus over Ethernet makes it easier to develop software without being physically connected to the boiler). [mbusd](https://github.com/3cky/mbusd) or any hardware Modbus/RTU to Modbus/TCP bridge will work.

## Performance
This API accesses the entire array of Modbus registers using a handful of Modbus reads and caches results with a configurable TTL. Reading and reporting all known registers takes a few hundred milliseconds.

## Usage
API contains a `__main__` that dumps current boiler state and illustrates usage:

## Logging
A trivial logging script that stores a subset of the available data using SQLite3
is included in `log_sqlite3.py`. This script can be run periodically by `cron`.

For example, on a Linux host the user might issue `crontab -e` to edit their `crontab` and add the following line to log the state of the boiler ever minute:
```
* * * * * ~/sage2-boiler/log_sqlite3.py
```
Be sure the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt` are installed and available
